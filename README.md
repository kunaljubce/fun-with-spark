# hadoop-and-pyspark-projects
This is a placeholder for all my Hadoop projects including PySpark, Hive, Kafka etc. The files and folders are named in a way that helps identifying the corresponding code and data easily. Forexample, for the code transactions.py, there is a folder named transactions under /data which contains all necessary datasets used for the code.

Project 1 - To identify:
		a) All transactions for each account that have the same transaction_source and same transaction_amount in both months
		b) All accounts that have transactions in either month but not both.
The datasets are for the months August and September and have 2000 records each. The code is written in Python and Spark.
